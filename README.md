# GCBRGCN:Integration of ceRNA and RGCN to identify GC biomarkers
The GCBRGCN model is a novel approach to discovery biomarker for gastric cancer, integrating a ceRNA network with omics data and utilizing the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to predict biomarkers. And CBRGCN provides a more holistic and more accurate prediction of cancer biomarkers. This approach has the potential to greatly enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

## Installation & Dependencies
The code was written in Python 3 and R, while being tested primarily on Python 3.7 and R 4.3.1, but should run on any operating system that supports Python and R.

##Document interpretation
‘HAN’ and ‘GCN ‘ are the baseline model.
‘RGCN ‘is the primary model.
‘RGCN_Ablation’ is used ablation experiment.
‘RGCN_CV’ is used for simple cross-validation.
‘Biomarker analysis’ indicates the analysis process of biomarkers predicted by the model.
‘Machine learning’ Indicates the baseline machine learning algorithm
